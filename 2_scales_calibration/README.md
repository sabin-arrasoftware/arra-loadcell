# Load Cell GUI

## Description
This Python code provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying the output values from load cells. It uses the Tkinter library to create the GUI and will include functionality to periodically update the load cell values and display them in the GUI. For the moment the output values are generated randomly.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (included in Python standard library)

## Usage
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the Tkinter library if it is not already available. You can check if it is installed by running `python -m tkinter` in the terminal. If it is not installed, you can install it using your package manager or by following the instructions specific to your operating system.
3. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the Python code.
5. Run the following command to start the Load Cell GUI: python3 GUI_script.py
6. The GUI window will appear, displaying the load cell values.
7. The load cell values will be updated periodically (every 1 second by default) and displayed in the GUI.
